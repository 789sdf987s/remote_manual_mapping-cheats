Just discontinued projects that I haven't modified for 3-5 years.


I guess it can be useful for some people that are starting game cheating or anti-cheating development under windows.

This contains a manual mapper that supports tls, imports, relocs, and injection from a remote computer. (Done with sockets)

It has some cheats aswell for NieR Automata and NFS Payback, CS:GO.

The encryption scheme is wrong since the public keys can be intercepted and modified by the attacker.


By the way, the whole code design is kinda crappy in my opinion because I was learning while doing it, so please be sure to take it as an example, not for your actual work.
